:summary: Hacklab Jyväskylä's lab is located at the Keskikatu 18 A basement. On Tuesdays we have an "open doors" club evening from 18 o'clock on.

We host weekly club nights every Tuesday 18–21 and Saturday 14–17. The doors
are open until the last key-carrying member leaves, which is often after
midnight. Questions are best answered on our IRC-channel on Freenode,
#hacklab.jkl or on `our Telegram group <https://t.me/HacklabJKL>`_.

Our lab space is located at Keskikatu 18 A, basement.
