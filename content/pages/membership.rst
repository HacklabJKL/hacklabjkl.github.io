If you are interested in our activity, please come and see us on our club night
every Tuesday after 18:00!

Hacklab Jyväskylä depends on monthly membership fees to pay for the rent of the
lab space. Membership is divided into two types.

Basic membership has a monthly fee of 10€, and gives you access to the lab and
the right to keep personal property there. For 20€/month, you can get a key
which allows you to visit the lab at your own convenience.

If you are not able to afford the basic membership, you can apply for a reduced
fee of 5€/month for the first 12 months. You will get the same benefits. In
this case, please give a brief application for the discount in the form.

To apply for membership, please use the form below. We will contact you via
email.
